# Wine_Quality_Model
Summary
In this project, I build three(3) models namely;

Decision Tree Model

Logistics Regression Model

Random Forest Model

Decision-Tree Classifier model to predict the quality. The model yields a very good performance as indicated by the model accuracy which was found to be 1.0.

Summary of metrics for decision tree model

Precision = 1.0

Recall = 1.0

Accuracy = 1.0

F1 Score = 1.0

In the Logistic Regression model with criterion gini index, the training-set accuracy score is 0.983 while the test-set accuracy to be 0.984. These two values are quite comparable. So, there is no sign of overfitting.
Summary of metrics for Logistic Regression model

Precision = 0.973

Recall = 0.983

Accuracy = 0.984

F1 Score = 0.978

Similarly, in the Random Forest model, the summary of metrics for random forest model entails the following;
Precision = 0.973820395738204

Recall = 0.9863013698630136

Accuracy = 0.9863013698630136

F1 Score = 0.9797706275884038

The metrics obtained from the three different models shows that the decision tree model does excellently well in predicting the quality of wine for the selected features

Now, based on the above analysis we can conclude that our classification model accuracy is very good. Our model is doing a very good job in terms of predicting the class labels.

Lastly, confusion matrixes and classification reports of all the models yields very good model performance
